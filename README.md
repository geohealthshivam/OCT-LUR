#ESR08 GEO-C project

## OCT-Scripts for GEO-C project 
The repository contains the script for developing the LUR model using open data. The LUR scripts used in this project uses the data from open data sources for developing the air pollution LUR estimation.

## Guidelines
The guide to using each file in the repository is as follows:
1. Code for extracting data.R contain the scripts to extract the variables required for extracting variables for regression modelling.
2. LUR_OCT.RData contains the environment used for the analyses in the project and can be used as a sandbox to experiment and play around the method.
3. Land_use_regression_new1.html file is the markdown knitted in HTML format to guide you through the code used during the research and development process.
4. Land_use_regression_new1.pdf file is the markdown knitted in pdf format to guide you through the code used during the research and development process.
5. Regression_for selected variables at different configuration setup. R file contain script used for developing regression and plotting the results for analyses.
6. Regression and variable selection.R is the file which contains the script used for using the regression developed in the last step for prediction and data visualisation of the outcome of the LUR model
